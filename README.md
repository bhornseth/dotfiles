@bhornseth dotfiles
===================

Dead-simple setup for \*nix machines to set up a box the way it was meant.

Installation
------------
<pre>
git clone git@github.com:bhornseth/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd !$
rake install
</pre>

That's it.

Environment
-----------
I hack on a Gentoo Linux box during the day, and a Macbook Pro at night, so the files 
in here should work with the default tools on either setup.

moar_info?
----------
Soon.
